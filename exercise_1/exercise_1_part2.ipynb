    "In this exercise we will demonstrate two ways of setting up a simulation of a protein-ligand complex in OpenMM. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Use the OpenMM package [openmmforcefields](https://github.com/openmm/openmmforcefields) and an external package called Open Force Field toolkit ([openff-toolkit](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit)).\n",
    "\n",
    "  This covers the following steps:\n",
    "    - Loading in the ligand with `openff-toolkit`\n",
    "    - Parameterising the ligand force-field with `openmmforcefields`\n",
    "    - Combining the topologies\n",
    "    - Solvating and simulating\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Note this notebook is based on the [openff-toolkit's example](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit/blob/stable/examples/toolkit_showcase/toolkit_showcase.ipynb) . We would like to give credit to the Open ForceField Authors.*\n",

    "- **Method 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Using a third party tool (BioSimSpace) to produce OpenMM compatible input files.\n",
    "\n",
    "  This covers the following steps:\n",
    "    - Using a BSS workflow to take the protein+ligand files and produce Amber format input files\n",
    "    - Use OpenMM \n",

    "\n",
    " - openmmforcefields\n",
